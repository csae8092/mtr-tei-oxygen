## what is markup

Markup refers to a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. The annotations are often used to define the structure and presentation of the document. Markup languages use tags to define elements within the document.

Types of Markup Languages

1. **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: Used for creating web pages and web applications.
1. **XML (eXtensible Markup Language)**: Used for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
1. **Markdown**: A lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax, often used for writing documentation and readme files.

Markup languages are essential for defining the structure and presentation of documents, making them easier to read and process by both humans and machines.
